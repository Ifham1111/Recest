    <p>First these are the type of writing funcion
    
    what are the function types in react js

    1. Class Component
    2. Functional Component

    what is a class component?
    A class component is a javascript class that extends the React.Component class. It has access to all the functions of the React.Component class such as render(), componentDidMount(), etc. It also has access to the state object and lifecycle methods. It is also called a stateful component.
    
    what is a functional component?
    A functional component is a javascript function that returns a React element. It is also called a stateless component as it does not have access to the state object and lifecycle methods. It is also called a dumb component as it does not have any internal state of its own. It is also called a presentational component as it is mainly used for presenting the UI.

    2. What is the difference between state and props?
    State is mutable whereas props are immutable.
    State is used to update the component whereas props are used to render the component.
    State is internal and controlled by the component itself whereas props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        Compenents name's first letter should be capital and npm start
    </p>

    <p>
        The one components return type should be the html and its should be contain the one parent tage.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we eants to use class in html therefor we have to use as classNaame = "name" and we can use nesting componet for our requirments as >> reusablity
    </p>

    <p>
        we can use created components in varius files so that we have to export our component >> export default Component name;
    </p>

    <p>
        delete unwanted file from automaticallly created app and then we have to keep only the index.js and after orgarnize better file managment
    </p>

    <p>
        if you create css file then import it to relevent file and we can create style for it eith in the component then use variable like class then apply it to the relevent html tag use {} for easiest way then className as a style theses are rare to used
    </p>

    <p>
        props?
        props are the properties that we can pass to the components and we can use it in the components
        pass parametre as js
    </p>

    <p>
        object destructering 
        const name = {
            first: 'tamil',
            last: 'hackls'
        }
        const {first, last} = name;
        console.log(first, last);
        explain it
        1. create an objcet with key value pairs
        2. create a variable with the same name as the key
        3. assign the value of the key to the variable
        4. use the variable
    </p>

    <p>
        conditinal rendering 
        if we want to render the component based on the condition we can use the conditinal rendering

        provev the code snippet
        if (condition) {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>hello</h1>
                </div>
            )
        } else {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>goodbye</h1>
                </div>
            )
        }
    </p>

    <p>
        key is identify the every(elemts) components for unique id
    </p>

    <p>
        According to hooks its use to having on a temp storage for any changes having on dynamic website and idt dont wanto rereder the webiste its normally update in the Ui

        for that 
        import React, {useState}

        //state use saving real time changes in temp storage and hooks variable cant change that values in relatime therfor we are declaring second variavble for it to ubdate then we can able to use that first created hooks variable

        const [dynamicSize, setdynamicSize] = useState(size);
        console.log("dynamic Size", dynamicSize);
      
        
        //>>plus point of this using no need to hard code like props.plantData.name like wise
        const handleClick = () => {
          console.log("clicked");
          setdynamicSize(dynamicSize + 2);
      };
    </p>

    <p>
        useEffect ()
        //useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components. It is similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate in classes. It is called after every render of the component. It is used to perform side effects such as fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, etc. It is also used to perform cleanup operations such as clearing the interval, cancelling subscriptions, etc. It is also called a lifecycle hook. >>chatgpt

        //useEffect
        //in first parameter we have to give parametere and in second parametre dependancies array when the dependancy array empty it'll run only the first time when the the page load if we are giving the dipendancies then the componetns monitor that dipendancies according to aour condition
        useEffect( () => {
          console.log("My code..")
        }
        ,[] );
      
        useEffect( () => {
          console.log("dynamicSize" , dynamicSize);
          if(dynamicSize > 100) {
            alert("Plant grown sucessfully");
          }
        }
        ,[dynamicSize] );

        and we can code function seperatley and then call in to the useeffect hooks
    </p>

    <p> these all about the life cycle of react

          //life cycle of react >> (when that all start) mount , unmount, update
        
          // when the component is happen defaultly the rturn of the components happen then when we using hoooks specially useEfeect without dependencies thats mean when first time components mount that it is want to happen 

          useEffect(() => {
            console.log("My code..");
          }, []);
        
          //when the components unmount that time we have to specify the return what should be happening next
          useEffect(() => {
            //set timeout, set interval, clear inteerval
            const interval = setInterval(() => {
              if(dynamicSize < 100) {
                setdynamicSize(dynamicSize + 2);
              }
            }, 1000);
            
            return () => clearInterval(interval);
        
          }, [dynamicSize, name]);

          //when the using dependancies that all wnt to be a update
          useEffect(() => {
            console.log("dynamicSize", dynamicSize);
            if (dynamicSize > 100) {
              alert("Plant grown sucessfully");
            }
          }, [dynamicSize]);
    </p>
    <!-- useRef


    //Asynchrounous js api data fetching

    //local storage state

    //recipie app --> 

    <p>
        thers two methods to load components 
        1. basic components >> function components
        2. Class components >>
