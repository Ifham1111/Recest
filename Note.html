    <p>First these are the type of writing funcion
    
    what are the function types in react js

    1. Class Component
    2. Functional Component

    what is a class component?
    A class component is a javascript class that extends the React.Component class. It has access to all the functions of the React.Component class such as render(), componentDidMount(), etc. It also has access to the state object and lifecycle methods. It is also called a stateful component.
    
    what is a functional component?
    A functional component is a javascript function that returns a React element. It is also called a stateless component as it does not have access to the state object and lifecycle methods. It is also called a dumb component as it does not have any internal state of its own. It is also called a presentational component as it is mainly used for presenting the UI.

    2. What is the difference between state and props?
    State is mutable whereas props are immutable.
    State is used to update the component whereas props are used to render the component.
    State is internal and controlled by the component itself whereas props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.

    <p>
        Compenents name's first letter should be capital and npm start
    </p>

    <p>
        The one components return type should be the html and its should be contain the one parent tage.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we eants to use class in html therefor we have to use as classNaame = "name" and we can use nesting componet for our requirments as >> reusablity
    </p>

    <p>
        we can use created components in varius files so that we have to export our component >> export default Component name;
    </p>

    <p>
        delete unwanted file from automaticallly created app and then we have to keep only the index.js and after orgarnize better file managment
    </p>

    <p>
        if you create css file then import it to relevent file and we can create style for it eith in the component then use variable like class then apply it to the relevent html tag use {} for easiest way then className as a style theses are rare to used
